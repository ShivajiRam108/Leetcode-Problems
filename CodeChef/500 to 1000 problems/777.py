Mutated Minions
----------------
-> Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious.
->  Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight,
-> he has built a transmogrifier â€” a machine which mutates minions.
-> Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer.
->  The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value.
-> Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.
-> Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.

Input Format
-------------
-> The first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of test cases.
-> Each test case contains of 2 lines of input.
-> The first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement
-> The next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions

Output Format
--------------
-> For each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.

# Answer
N = int(input())
for i in range(N):
    X , Y = map(int, input().split())
    res = 0
    numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for j in numbers:
        if (j + Y) % 7 == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)
