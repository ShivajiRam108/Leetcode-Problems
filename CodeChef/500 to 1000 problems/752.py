Endless Appetizers
------------------
-> Life is a like a box of of mozzarella sticks.
-> You never know what you're gonna get, but you can predict with 100 percent accuracy that it will be a mozzarella stick.
-> Chef's colleague issued a challenge to Chef: "If you eat more than X mozzarella sticks, I'll give you 30 rupees for each extra one you eat".
-> For example, if X=5 and Chef eats 8 sticks, he would receive 90 rupees because he ate 3 extra sticks.
-> You know that the restaurant serves Y mozzarella sticks per plate.
-> You also know that Chef received R rupees from his colleague as a result of the challenge.
-> What's the maximum number of plates of mozzarella sticks that Chef could have ordered?

Note:

-> Chef won't order a new plate till he finishes eating all the sticks from the previous one.
-> However, it's possible that Chef didn't finish all the sticks from the final plate he ordered.
-> See the explained examples below for more clarification.

Input Format
-------------
-> The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
-> Each test case consists of one line of input, containing three space-separated integers X,Y, and 
-> R â€” the lower limit on the number of sticks, the number of sticks on a single plate, and the money received by Chef.

Output Format
--------------
-> For each test case, output on a new line the answer: the maximum number of plates Chef could have ordered.

Sample:-

input                  output 
4
7 5 30                   2
16 5 0                   4
15 9 120                 3
23 1 2130                94

#Answer

N = int(input())
for i in range(N):
    A , B , C = map(int, input().split())
    extra_sticks = C // 30 
    total_sticks = A + extra_sticks
    max_sticks = (total_sticks + B - 1) // B 
    print(max_sticks)
