-------------
-> Two friends Chef and Chefina are currently on floors A and B respectively.
-> They hear an announcement that prizes are being distributed on the ground floor and so decide to reach the ground floor as soon as possible.
-> Chef can climb down X floors per minute while Chefina can climb down Y floors per minute.
-> Determine who will reach the ground floor first (ie. floor number 0).
-> In case both reach the ground floor together, print Both.

Input Format
-------------
-> The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
-> The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers A, B, X, and Y â€” the current floor
-> of Chef, the current floor of Chefina, speed of Chef and speed of Chefina in floors per minute respectively.

Output Format
--------------
-> For each test case, output on a new line:
-> Chef if Chef reaches the ground floor first.
-> Chefina if she reaches the ground floor first.
-> Both if both reach the ground floor at the same time.
-> You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase.
